# Global Energy & Emissions Analysis  

This project analyzes global energy consumption, renewable energy adoption, and CO₂ emissions using datasets from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/energy).  

# Key Features  
- Cleaned and prepared large-scale energy datasets (1950–2022)  
- Explored global trends in energy use and renewable adoption  
- Forecasted CO₂ emissions using regression models  
- Clustered countries by energy & emissions profiles  
- Created clear visualizations and correlation heatmaps  

# Tools & Libraries  
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)  

# Files  
- `Global_Energy_Emissions.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with full analysis  
- `clean_energy_data.csv` → Cleaned dataset (ready-to-use)  

# How to Run  
1. Clone/download the repository  
2. Install required libraries (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)  
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter/Anaconda and run all cells
